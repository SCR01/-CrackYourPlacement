I am taking on the #CrackYourPlacement challenge by Arsh Goyal, starting tomorrow, along with Dev Reddy! This 45-day challenge is designed to help kickstart our preparation and revision journey for securing our dream internships or placements.

ðŸ’¡ What is the #CrackYourPlacement Challenge?

- A structured 45-60 day plan to solve the DSA Sheet by Arsh, tackling 4-5 questions daily.

âœ¨ The sheet comprises around 270â€“280 carefully curated questions that have frequently appeared in interviews and online assessments for top product-based companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, Adobe, and many startups.

We will solve daily questions from the DSA Sheet and maintain a GitHub repository named #CrackYourPlacement to track our progress and share our solutions. This consistent practice will help us stay disciplined and make our preparation more effective.

We're taking this challenge to become interview-ready for the upcoming internship and placement seasons. This will keep us consistent in our preparation and open up opportunities for potential referrals, mentorship sessions, and dedicated test series for top companies.ðŸŽ¯
